<h3>🎉 What Can I Do with the Free Version?</h3>

The free version of this plugin is very powerful and you can charge your members by using PayPal integration. However, we have created a Pro version which includes other great fetures to make your subscriptions website even better.

Please check the <a href="https://userscontrol.com/compare-versions/?utm_source=wp_homepage_compare&utm_medium=wp-description&utm_campaign=UC_WP">free vs pro </a> table.

<h3><strong>PREMIUM FEATURES:</strong></h3>

Although the free version offers a wide range of features to protect your  website content we have a premium version to empower your subscriptions website. Below there is a breakdown of the main features available on UsersControl Pro version.

<h3>User Profiles</h3>

Having the capability to create elegant user profiles is essential when you are building a user community. Your members will love an outstanding profile where they can display their photos, posts and any kind of personal information.

<h3>Advanced Content Protection:</h3>

The content protection module is very flexible and helps you to protect content in four different ways. 

👉 - <strong>Protect entire posts and pages</strong>. You can set a custom message to display when the members try to access the protected post. Also, you can set a custom title and even hide the entire post from the website.

👉 - <strong>Logged in Members Protection</strong>.  This method will make either posts or pages visible to logged in members only.

👉  - <strong>Membership Protection</strong>. You can make posts and pages visible to only certain subscription plans. For example: Platinum Members will be able to see Post A and Post B. Gold Members can see Post F and Post D.

👉 - <strong>Partial Content Protection</strong>. This allows you to hide just part of a post’s content. This is useful to let your members access to just a small section of your content without hiding the whole post.

<h3>Recurring Payments:</h3>
You'll be able to track how many subscribers you have, when they're being billed, and how much revenue you're generating from the recurring payments — which means you'll always know how much revenue your subscription website can count on as you continue to grow.

<h3>Recurring Subscriptions:</h3>

Start receiving recurring payments for your subscribers easily. The plugin allows you to create subscription plans and start receiving payments through PayPal. User Control has a flexible subscriptions module.  Monetize your site selling unlimited memberships, single payment or recurring paid subscriptions.

<h3>Multiple Subscriptions per user:</h3>

Sometimes you might need to allow your members to purchase multiple subscription plans. The premium version of UsersControl allows users to purchase more than one membership plan and get access to different content of your website.

<h3>Role Based Content Protection:</h3>

WordPress has a flexible Role Management module which determines what the user can do and see in your website. We have developed a module within UsersControl that assigns Roles to your users based on the subscription plan they purchase.  This means that you can protect posts and pages based on the User's Role.

<h3>Membership Based protection:</h3>

UsersControl is a powerful plugin that helps you to protect the content of your whole website, by installing the pro version you can protect the content of your website based on your member subscriptions. You can show Post A and Post B to only Gold Members. This makes the plugin very flexible and adaptable to any subscription WordPress site.

<h3>Unlimited Registration Forms:</h3>

Displaying a clear and easy to understand registration form to your user is the key to sell paid subscriptions on your website. UsersControl comes with a drag & drop form builder which allows you to create custom registration forms. Also, you can have multiple registration forms with different fields, you can make available different forms in different sections of your website.

Besides, the registration forms are fully integrated with the WordPress Role system. Which means you can assign a custom Role to your subscribers right after the registration happens.
